# ReaderWriterDatabaseTemplate
Reader Writer is a classic synchronization problem, that I implemented in C++ for my CSI 500 class. I implemented it as a HASHMAP of character and integer with a reader writer lock. The Reader writer lock is a new feature of C++ 14 and can be extended to make a database if we make a HASMAP of defined data structure using STRUCT. It is made of all the new features of the C++ 14 and I am planning to make an UNSTRUCTURED DATABASE that's a combination of both MongoDB like Document based structure and Apache Cassandra like Key-Column Value Pair. Just keep clubbing the columns together.
